We are very open to contributions!

[Currently](https://github.com/solokeys/solo/issues), most work will go towards

* implementing STM32L432
* implementing NFC
* adding documentation and improving accessability of the code

In the future, we would love to see creative plugins/extensions, putting the TRNG and other features of the STM32L432 to good use! 

Feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/solokeys/solo/pulls) at any time, we don't currently have a formal contribution process.

If you want to discuss your plans in quasi-realtime beforehand, you can also join our [solokeys.public](https://keybase.io/team/solokeys.public) Keybase team.
